# ========== HELP

# In this example, setup() is called with additional meta-information,
# which is recommended when distribution packages have to be built.
# For the extension itself, it specifies preprocessor defines,
# include directories, library directories, and libraries.
# Depending on the compiler, distutils passes this information in
# different ways to the compiler.
# For example, on Unix, this may result in the compilation commands

# ```
# gcc -DNDEBUG -g -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -DMAJOR_VERSION=1 \
#     -DMINOR_VERSION=0 -I/usr/local/include \
#     -I/usr/local/include/python2.2 -c demo.c \
#     -o build/temp.linux-i686-2.2/demo.o

# gcc -shared build/temp.linux-i686-2.2/demo.o -L/usr/local/lib -ltcl83
#     -o build/lib.linux-i686-2.2/demo.so
# ```

# These lines are for demonstration purposes only; distutils users
# should trust that distutils gets the invocations right.

# The manifest template has one command per line, where each command specifies
# a set of files to include or exclude from the source distribution. For an
# example, again we turn to the Distutilsâ€™ own manifest template:

# include *.txt
# recursive-include examples *.txt *.py
# prune examples/sample?/build

# The meanings should be fairly clear: include all files in the
# distribution root matching *.txt, all files anywhere under the examples
# directory matching *.txt or *.py, and exclude all directories matching
# examples/sample?/build. All of this is done after the standard include
# set, so you can exclude files from the standard set with explicit
# instructions in the manifest template. (Or, you can use the --no-defaults
# option to disable the standard set entirely.)
# There are several other commands available in the manifest template
# mini-language; see section Creating a source distribution:
# the sdist command.
