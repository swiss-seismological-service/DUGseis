   abstract = {In-situ acoustic emission (AE) monitoring is carried out in mines, tunnels and underground laboratories in the context of structural health monitoring, in decameter-scale research projects investigating the physics of earthquake nucleation and propagation and in research projects looking into the seismo-hydro-mechanical response of the rock mass in the context of hydraulic stimulations or nuclear waste storage. In addition surface applications e.g. monitoring rock faces of large construction sites, rock fall areas and rock slopes are documented in the literature. In geomechanical investigations in-situ AE monitoring provides information regarding the stability of underground cavities, the state of stress and the integrity of the rock mass. The analysis of AE events recorded in-situ allows to bridge the observational gap between the studies of faulting processes in laboratory and studies of larger natural and induced earthquakes. This chapter provides an overview of various projects involving in-situ AE monitoring underground with a focus on recent achievements in the field. In-situ AE monitoring networks are able to record AE activity from distances up to 200 m, but the monitoring limits depend strongly on the extension of the network, geological and tectonic conditions. Very small seismic events with source sizes on approximately decimeter to millimeter scale are detected. In conclusion in-situ AE monitoring is a useful tool to observe instabilities in rock long before any damage becomes directly visible and is indispensable in high-resolution observations of rock volume deformation in decameter in-situ rock experiments.},

@article{Villiger2020,
   abstract = {We performed a series of 12 hydraulic stimulation experiments in a 20m×20m×20m foliated, crystalline rock volume intersected by two distinct fault sets at the Grimsel Test Site, Switzerland. The goal of these experiments was to improve our understanding of stimulation processes associated with high-pressure fluid injection used for reservoir creation in enhanced or engineered geothermal systems. In the first six experiments, pre-existing fractures were stimulated to induce shear dilation and enhance permeability. Two types of shear zones were targeted for these hydroshearing experiments: (i) ductile ones with intense foliation and (ii) brittle-ductile ones associated with a fractured zone. The second series of six stimulations were performed in borehole intervals without natural fractures to initiate and propagate hydraulic fractures that connect the wellbore to the existing fracture network. The same injection protocol was used for all experiments within each stimulation series so that the differences observed will give insights into the effect of geology on the seismo-hydromechanical response rather than differences due to the injection protocols. Deformations and fluid pressure were monitored using a dense sensor network in boreholes surrounding the injection locations. Seismicity was recorded with sensitive in situ acoustic emission sensors both in boreholes and at the tunnel walls. We observed high variability in the seismic response in terms of seismogenic indices, b values, and spatial and temporal evolution during both hydroshearing and hydrofracturing experiments, which we attribute to local geological heterogeneities. Seismicity was most pronounced for injections into the highly conductive brittle-ductile shear zones, while the injectivity increase on these structures was only marginal. No significant differences between the seismic response of hydroshearing and hydrofracturing was identified, possibly because the hydrofractures interact with the same pre-existing fracture network that is reactivated during the hydroshearing experiments. Fault slip during the hydroshearing experiments was predominantly aseismic. The results of our hydraulic stimulations indicate that stimulation of short borehole intervals with limited fluid volumes (i.e., the concept of zonal insulation) may be an effective approach to limit induced seismic hazard if highly seismogenic structures can be avoided.},
